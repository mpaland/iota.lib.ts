Typescript library for IOTA

## Highlights and design goals
IOTA is the next best crypto currency, cause it's post-quantum save and uses a decentralized "Tangle".  
This library is based on the IOTA JS reference implementation iota.lib.js.  
Many modern projects use Typescript as of today, which has a lot of advantages regarding type checking, future compatibility etc.  
Of course with creating some typings, the iota.lib.js can be used in TS projects. But having an independent, build up from scratch and **CLEAN** iota.lib.ts should give a lot of benefits...
